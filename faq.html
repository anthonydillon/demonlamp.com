						<dt>Is it possible to purchase a Demon Lamp via PayPal?</dt>
						<dd>A PayPal payment system will be added to the website in the coming weeks.</dd> 

						<dt>Is it possible to get delivery concessions if ordering 2 or more lamps?</dt>
						<dd>Sorry no we can not give a discount. We get no discount on any less than 12 lamps being dispatched. It is considered to be a large package particularly for international delivery. We are not a large company and we are not dispatching a large number of units. So we have no special deals in place with couriers.</dd>

						<dt>Is the VAT included in the price?</dt>
						<dd>Yes</dd>

						<dt>Is the Shipping cost included in the price?</dt>
						<dd>No, see shipping costs on the website <a href="http://www.demonlamps.com/shipping">www.demonlamps.com/shipping</a> and/or in FAQ question below.</dd>

						Europe &pound;20<br />
						International &pound;45</dd>

						<dt>What is it made of?</dt>
						<dd>Polypropolene (plastic)

						<dt>Does it take batteries?</dt>
						<dd>No</dd>

						<dt>Can we keep it outside?</dt>
						<dd>Please do not use the lamp outside.</dd>
