				<h3>Exporting Outside the UK</h3>

				<p>Demon lamp will work in any country with a 230 - 240 volt supply, as 
				long as you use a UK 3 Pin plug to 2 Pin Plug Adapter. Look at the map
				above, if your country is green it will work. </p>

				<p>On orders exporting to countries outside the EU which use 110 Volts,
				for example USA, Canada and Mexico, the energy saving bulb holder
				will be replaced with a standard E12 cord set with 2 pin plug.
				Unfortunately we cannot supply the bulb with this.</p>

				<p>If you order goods for delivery outside the UK, they may be subject to 
				import duties and taxes which are levied when the delivery reaches the
				specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such
				import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these 
				charges and cannot predict their amount. Please also note that you must
				comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the Country for which
				the goods are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of
				any such laws.</p>
